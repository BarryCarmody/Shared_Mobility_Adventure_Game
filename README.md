# Shared-Mobility Adventure Java OOP Game
This is my first project in Java and first attempt at developing a game.
Project completed 2nd May 2024

# Project Description
COMP30820 Java Programming (Conv)
The Shared-Mobility Adventure Game is an educational Java-based game designed to teach
school students about the concepts of shared mobility and its environmental impact. The
game features an imaginary/real city with multiple modes of transport, allowing players to
choose from a set of available route options to reach a destination, to collect the GEMs that
appear on the screen. Each route option will have its associated carbon footprint, the number
of modes used, and the time taken, and the main goal of the game is to encourage players to
make environment-friendly transportation choices.

This game will start with an entry level, where GEM appear on the screen one by one. The
second level will show two GEMs at a time and will make the decision making more
complicated.

Goals:
The overarching objective of this project is for you to excel in your Java Programming and
meet the learning objectives of the module. Introduce the target Audience (e.g., students) to
shared mobility concepts and their positive impact on the environment.

Objectives of the Game:

● The player should collect the GEMs appeared on the map.

● To level up, the player should not exceed a certain threshold related to their carbon
footprint. (Hint: You can imagine the carbon footprint budget of each character as
their level of health).

● The player should be presented by educational pop-ups.

● By looking at the summary of each level, the player should be able to understand
which of the choices made was the best and which one the worst (Hint: Score board
and color coding).

Main Logic of the Game: The game should be designed in a way that allows the player to level up.
When the game starts the player (located at the starting point) will be presented with the
imaginary or real map of a city, a number of GEMs that appear at random locations on the
map (At the first level one by one). The player should be able to see the multiple route
options (each including 1 or more transport mode) available to get to the location of the GEM
to collect it.
